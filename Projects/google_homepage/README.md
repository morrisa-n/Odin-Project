Made for The Odin Project's [Web Development 101 HTML/CSS project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css?ref=lnav)

Realized partway through I was working on the version with JS off, instead of the more modern version everyone else does. Oops. I may tackle the more modern version later. [Here](https://github.com/morrisa-n/Odin-Project/blob/master/Projects/google_homepage/google-with-JS-off.jpg) is what this version's supposed to look like when it's finished.

It looks good at full size, but it doesn't look so good when resized. I think I'm going to come back to it later and fix up things like the missing red-orange bar over the current page and the properly-sized highlights, once I've gotten a lot better at HTML and CSS. Then I'll do the modern version and the difficult project once I'm done.
